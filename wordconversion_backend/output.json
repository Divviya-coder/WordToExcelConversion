Constitutionalism refers to both the restriction on arbitrary governmental power and the\npromotion of rule of law.\n2. Constitutionalism is a philosophy that restrains government power even in the absence of a\nwritten Constitution, as long as democratic principles and political culture are strong.\n3. Constitutionalism and the Constitution are interdependent, as one cannot exist in practice without\nthe other.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 1 only\nc) 2 and 3 only\nd) 1 and 3 only\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1 is correct: Constitutionalism is primarily about limiting government authority to\nensure that no one, including the government, acts beyond the boundaries set by the law or\nConstitution. By restraining government power, it ensures that citizens' fundamental rights\u2014such\nas freedom of speech, equality, and due process\u2014are safeguarded. Thus fostering a balance\nbetween authority and liberty.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2 is correct: Constitutionalism can function without a written Constitution, as long as\ndemocratic principles, legal precedents, and strong political culture are in place to limit\ngovernment power. This is evident in countries like the UK, where Constitutionalism is practiced\nwithout a single written Constitution.\n\uf0b7 Statement 3 is incorrect: While Constitutionalism is an ideal that works through a Constitution,\nthe Constitution and Constitutionalism can exist independently. For example, the UK practices\nConstitutionalism without a codified Constitution, showing that a nation can function with one\nand not the other in a strict sense. However, it is essential that Constitutionalism prevails to\nsafeguard democratic governance.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following is not included in the Preamble of the Indian constitution\na) Economic Justice\nb) Political Equality\nc) Liberty of worship\nd) Equality of status\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Text of the preamble: WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India\ninto a SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens\nJUSTICE, social, economic and political;\nLIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship;\nEQUALITY of status and of opportunity; and to promote among them all\nFRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity and integrity of the Nation;\nIN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT,\nENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.\n\uf0b7 We can\u2019t find any word which emphasis \u201cPolitical equality\u201d in the Preamble.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following is true regarding the role of the Preamble in ensuring the unity and\nintegrity of India?\na) The Preamble emphasizes liberty over fraternity to secure unity.\nb) The Preamble focuses on economic justice as the primary driver of unity.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\nc) The Preamble advocates fraternity to assure the dignity of individuals, thereby strengthening\nunity and integrity of the nation.\nd) The Preamble\u2019s role in unity is primarily linked to the enforcement of Fundamental Duties.\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1: The Preamble does not emphasis liberty over fraternity ad unity of the nation.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2: Economic justice is guaranteed by Preamble but not seen as a driver of unity.\n\uf0b7 Statement 4: Preamble had no reference to Fundamental Duty.\n\uf0b7 The Preamble explicitly mentions fraternity as a core value. The dignity of the individual is\ncrucial to this idea of fraternity because when individuals are treated with respect and fairness,\nthey are more likely to develop a sense of belonging and contribute positively to national unity. By\npromoting fraternity, the Constitution aims to break down barriers between various groups,\nreducing the risk of division or conflict and ensuring the unity and integrity of the nation.\n\uf0b7 The first and most extensive discussion on fraternity took place in Indira Sawhney v. Union of\nIndia,(1992). The idea of fraternity was used to justify the constitutional practice of reservation\nfor backward classes to bring about progress for marginalized sections of society. the Court\nreasoned that so long as inequality or lack of equal access to opportunity existed, unity of the\nnation would remain a distant dream thereby additionally hindering the promise of fraternity.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following statements describes the function of the constitution?\n1. It provides for the minimal co-ordination\n2. It promotes condition for a just society.\n3. It empowers people who are traditionally deprived.\n4. It promotes majority\u2019s will than the minorities.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 1 and 3 only\nc) 1, 2 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, 3 and 4\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 In India some people are deprived of basic rights due to its social order. Constitution empowers\nthose people who are traditionally deprived by helping them to realize an inclusive and collective\ngood that are common to all.\n\uf0b7 By having fundamental rights, the rights of minorities will not be trumped by the majority\npreferences. So it checks the tyranny of majority.\n\uf0b7 The other statements about the constitution given are correct.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Doctrine of Adoption:\n1. Legislature was not the body that first made the law but that authority continued it. In the process\nof continuing it, the legislature may be said to have adopted them.\n2. Article 372 of the Constitution of India reflects the Doctrine of Adoption.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 According to Hobbes, LEGISLATURE was not the body that first made the law but the authority\nthat continued it. In the process of continuing the laws, the legislature may be said to haveARAM IAS ACADEMY\nadopted them. Article 372 of the Constitution which seeks to confine the laws in force, reflects\nthe Doctrine of Adoption.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding under current technological advancements:\n1. The total carbon emissions from hybrid cars are lesser than that of electric vehicles (EVs).\n2. Hybrid vehicles may only be medium term solution, but electric vehicles will be long term\nsolution.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: C\nWhy in news: Hybrids are a medium-term solution for India, a less polluting option than EVs: Report\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Hybrid vehicles are a practical medium-term solution for India's decarbonisation drive as the\ncountry moves towards eventual electrification, according to a report by HSBC Global Research.\n\uf0b7 Under the current circumstances, the total carbon emissions (well to wheel) from hybrid cars is\nlesser than that of electric vehicles (EVs) and it may take 7-10 years for EV and hybrid emissions\nto converge. Hence statement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 \"Hybrids are critical not just from a cost of ownership perspective, but also for India's de-\ncarbonisation drive,\" the report said. Hybrids are much less polluting than EVs, it said, adding that\nthe \"total carbon emissions i.e. Well to Wheel (WTW) from an EV is currently 158 g/km vs 201\ng/km for diesel, 176g/km for petrol, and 133 g/km for hybrid\".\n\uf0b7 This means that hybrids are 34 per cent, 25 per cent, and 16 per cent less polluting than diesel,\npetrol, and a proportionate EV, respectively, it added.\n\uf0b7 Total emissions include both vehicle emissions -- tank to wheel (TTW) and crude mining/refining\nemissions, power generation emissions -- well to tank (WTT), the report said.\n\uf0b7 In the case of EVs, only the power generation emissions have been incorporated and not coal\nproduction emissions, which would have skewed the equation further in favour of hybrids, it\nadded.\n\uf0b7 Stating that \"it may take 7-10 years for EV and hybrid emissions to converge\", the report said the\nnon-fossil share of power generation in India is currently 26 per cent (FY23) and the blended\nIndian power generation emission is 716g/kWh.\n\uf0b7 Total emissions from hybrid cars and EVs will converge if non-fossil power generation in India\nmoves up to 44 per cent, it said, adding, \"HSBC estimates that could take 7-10 years, while most\nother estimates are equal or less than this\".\n\uf0b7 \"By 2030, even if India's share of non-fossil fuel is 40 per cent, hybrids will release 8 per cent\nfewer emissions than EVs, down from 16 per cent today,\" the report said.\n\uf0b7 Although, over the long term, EVs are inevitable, the HSBC report said, \"We believe India needs to\nembrace hybrids over the next 5-10 years as a credible and practical roadmap to full\nelectrification.\"Hence statement-2 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Source: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/hybrids-are-a-medium-\nterm-solution-for-india-a-less-polluting-option-than-evs-\nreport/articleshow/107228797.cms?from=mdr\n\u0298 Which of the following statements about Digi Yatra project is not correct?\na) It is currently providing contactless, seamless processing of passengers at all international\nairports in India.\nb) In the Digi Yatra process, there is no central storage of passenger's Personally Identifiable\nInformation (PII) data.\nc) The data is shared by passengers directly, only when they travel and only to the origin Airport.\nd) Digi Yatra Foundation was set up as a joint venture under the Companies Act, 2013.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\nAnswer: A\nWhy in news: Amid concerns over Digi Yatra app data privacy, founders assert full control\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Digi Yatra is a mobile application-based facility conceived to achieve contactless, seamless\nprocessing of passengers at airports based on Facial Recognition Technology (FRT).\n\uf0b7 It is currently being implemented in selected airports. Not all international airports in India now\nhave Digi Yatra facility. Hence option-a is incorrect\n\uf0b7 It helps travelers pass through various checkpoints at the airports through paperless and\ncontactless processing using facial features to validate their identity and travel details.\n\uf0b7 In the Digi Yatra process, there is no central storage of passenger's Personally Identifiable\nInformation (PII) data.\n\uf0b7 All the passengers' data is encrypted and stored in the wallet of their smartphone. It is shared only\nbetween the passenger and the airport of travel origin, where the passenger's Digi Yatra ID needs\nto be validated.\n\uf0b7 The data is purged from the airport's system within 24 hours of departure of the flight. The data is\nshared by passengers directly, only when they travel and only to the origin Airport.\n\uf0b7 Source:https://government.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/technology/amid-concerns-\nover-digi-yatra-app-data-privacy-founders-assert-full-control/109387734\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Cancer:\n1. Oncology is a branch of medicine that focuses on the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and study\nof cancer.\n2. Cancer is fundamentally a genomic disease, characterized by uncontrolled cell division due to\ngenetic changes.\n3. World Health Organization anticipates a 60% reduction in the cancer burden over the next\ndecade.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 3 only\nb) 1 and 2 only\nc) 2 and 3 only\nd) 1 and 3 only\nAnswer: B\nWhy in news: From genomic medicine, a revolution rolls towards cancer care\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Cancer has emerged as a major public health concern worldwide with about 20 million new\npatients being added every year.\n\uf0b7 The World Health Organisation has estimated the cancer burden will increase by almost 60%\nover the next decade, potentially rendering it the second major cause of death. Hence statement\n3 is incorrect.\n\uf0b7 India alone adds approximately 1.4 million new cancer cases every year, with almost 1 in 1,000\nIndians being diagnosed annually, per the National Cancer Registry.\n\uf0b7 Cancer is fundamentally a genomic disease, characterized by uncontrolled cell division due to\ngenetic changes. Hence statement 2 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Genomic technologies, bolstered by initiatives like the Cancer Genome Atlas, have played a crucial\nrole in decoding the molecular underpinnings of cancer.\n\uf0b7 Oncology is a branch of medicine that specialises in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. It\nincludes Medical oncology, Radiation oncology. Hence statement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 The focus has shifted to precision oncology, with nearly a third of FDA-approved therapies relying\non DNA-based tests as biomarkers.\n\uf0b7 Whole-genome sequencing, capable of deciphering an individual\u2019s entire DNA \u2013 all 3.2 billion\nnucleotides \u2013 in a single, comprehensive test.\n\uf0b7 This approach involves sequencing both healthy blood-derived DNA and cancerous tissue or\ntumour-derived DNA, offering a holistic understanding.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 The future of cancer care involves a shift in clinical testing, integrating genomics, protein studies,\nand metabolite analysis (multi-omics).\n\uf0b7 This holistic approach enhances the understanding of tumors, identifies molecular subtypes, and\ninforms cancer progression and treatment.\n\uf0b7 Source: https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/precision-oncology-therapies-whole-\ngenome-sequencing-explained/article67782878.ece\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS):\n1. It is mandatory for state governments to link MGNREGA job cards to ABPS.\n2. Implementing this has improved the fund transfer time to all active workers under MGNREGA.\n3. ABPS helps in eliminating intermediaries and reduces corruption.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\nAns: C\nWhy in news:Aadhaar-based pay a bad idea for MGNREGS\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 On January 1, the Rural Development Ministry made Aadhaar-Based Payment Systems (ABPS)\nmandatory in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).\nHence statement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 This is after five deadline extensions by the Union government, disregarding several\nmemorandums by workers to the Ministry to not make ABPS mandatory.\n\uf0b7 Government argues that using ABPS ensures that payments are made to the rightful beneficiaries,\nreducing the chances of fraud and corruption and eliminating intermediaries. Hence statement 3\nis correct.\n\uf0b7 Digital records make it easier to track and audit payments and also help improve financial\ninclusion.\n\uf0b7 However, the over-reliance on technical tools has resulted in problematic implementation, with\nbeneficiaries devoid of a proper recourse for corrections in the system.\n\uf0b7 Data analysed by LibTech India suggest that the names of 7.6 crore workers have been deleted\nover the past 21 months due to discrepancies between the Aadhaar and the job card, among other\nreasons, with many of these done erroneously.\n\uf0b7 Around12.7% of these active workers are still not eligible due to technological adeptness or a lack\nof proper documentation. Hence statement 2 is incorrect.\n\uf0b7 Source: https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/aadhaar-based-pay-a-bad-idea-for-\nmgnregs/article67786940.ece\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Genocide Convention:\n1. It was the first legal instrument to codify genocide as a crime.\n2. It was the human rights treaty unanimously adopted by the United Nations General assembly.\n3. India is a State party to the Genocide Convention.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1, 2 and 3\nb) 1 and 2 only\nc) 2 and 3 only\nd) 1 and 3 only\nAns: A\nWhy in news: South Africa files genocide case against Israel at ICJ: Why the African nation supports\nGaza so strongly\nExplanation:ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG), or the\nGenocide Convention, is an international treaty that criminalizes genocide and obligates state\nparties to pursue the enforcement of its prohibition.\n\uf0b7 It was the first legal instrument to codify genocide as a crime, and the first human rights treaty\nunanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly, on 9 December 1948, during the\nthird session of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\uf0b7 The Convention entered into force on 12 January 1951 and has 152 state parties as of 2022.\n\uf0b7 The Genocide Convention was conceived largely in response to World War II.\n\uf0b7 The Convention defines genocide as any of five \"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or\nin part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\"\n\uf0b7 These five acts include killing members of the group, causing them serious bodily or mental harm,\nimposing living conditions intended to destroy the group, preventing births, and forcibly\ntransferring children out of the group.\n\uf0b7 The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of\nwar, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish\n\uf0b7 India ratified the convention in 1959; there is no legislation on the subject.\n\uf0b7 Hence all statements are correct.\n\uf0b7 Source:https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/everyday-explainers/why-south-africa-\nfiled-genocide-case-israel-icj-9089770/\n\u0298 In rural climates, dew formation is often observed more frequently than in urban areas. Which\nof the following reason explains this phenomenon?\na) Urban areas have less vegetation, reducing the potential for dew.\nb) Urban heat island effects lead to higher nocturnal temperatures, preventing ground cooling.\nc) Pollution in urban areas inhibits condensation processes.\nd) Rural areas have less atmospheric humidity compared to urban areas, favoring dew formation.\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The urban heat island effect keeps urban areas warmer at night, reducing the temperature drop\nnecessary for dew formation, unlike in rural areas.So, option B is correct\n\u0298 With reference to the concept of \"Temperature inversion,\" consider the following statements:\n1. Temperature inversion occurs when the normal lapse rate of the atmosphere is reversed, causing\nwarmer air to be trapped below cooler air.\n2. Temperature inversion is common in mountainous regions and valleys.\n3. This phenomenon enhances vertical air movement, increasing the possibility of thunderstorms.\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns:A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Temperature inversion refers to a situation where the normal atmospheric temperature lapse\nrate (where temperature decreases with altitude) is reversed. This means that cooler air is\ntrapped near the Earth's surface with warmer air above it.\n\uf0b7 Temperature inversion happens when the normal lapse rate is reversed, trapping cooler air\nbeneath warmer air. This is a typical feature of an inversion layer, especially during nighttime or\nin calm weather conditions.Hence, Statement 1 is correct\n\uf0b7 Inversion of Temperature is more commonly observed in mountainous regions and valleys, where\ncool air tends to settle at lower elevations, and warm air remains above, due to the topography\nand specific local conditions. Hence, Statement 2 is correct\n\uf0b7 Temperature inversion suppresses vertical air movement rather than enhancing it. This stable\natmospheric condition prevents the upward movement of air, leading to trapped pollutants andARAM IAS ACADEMY\nthe reduction of weather activities such as thunderstorms. Hence, Statement 3 is not correct.So,\noption A is correct\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding precipitation:\n1. All precipitation originates from clouds formed at low altitudes.\n2. Convectional precipitation is usually associated with long-lasting rains.\n3. Both drizzle and rain can only occur in nimbostratus cloud.\nHow many of the above given statement(s) is/are correct?\na) Only one\nb) Only two\nc) All three\nd) None of the above\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Precipitation can originate from clouds at different altitudes, not just low-level clouds. High-\naltitude clouds, such as cirrus or cumulonimbus, can also produce precipitation, especially during\nheavy rainfall or thunderstorms. Hence statement 1 is not correct\n\uf0b7 Convectional precipitation is generally linked to short, intense showers rather than prolonged\nrainfall. This occurs when the sun heats the Earth's surface, causing warm air to rise and cool,\noften leading to localized thunderstorms and heavy downpours. Hence statement 2 is not\ncorrectARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 Although nimbostratus clouds are commonly associated with continuous rain or drizzle, other cloud\ntypes, like stratus and cumulonimbus, can also produce precipitation. Therefore, precipitation is not\nlimited to nimbostratus clouds. Hence statement 3 is not correct.So, option D is correct\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. The temperature in the stratosphere decreases with altitude due to the absorption of UV radiation\n2. The stratospheric ozone layer is also responsible for absorbing infrared radiation, contributing to\nglobal warming.\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 In the stratosphere, temperature rises with altitude due to the absorption of ultraviolet (UV)\nradiation by the ozone layer. This occurs as ozone molecules absorb UV radiation, converting it\ninto heat, which leads to a temperature increase at higher altitudes. Hence statement 1 is not\ncorrect\n\uf0b7 The ozone layer primarily absorbs UV radiation, not infrared radiation. Infrared radiation is\nabsorbed by greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and methane (CH\u2084), in the\ntroposphere, contributing to global warming. The stratospheric ozone layer does not significantly\nabsorb infrared radiation or contribute directly to global warming. Hence statement 2 is not\ncorrect.So, option D is correct\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Doldrums:\n1. Doldrums are known for their high-pressure systems.\n2. The region of the Doldrums is characterized by strong prevailing winds\n3. The instability in the Doldrums can lead to the formation of tropical cyclones\nHow many of the above given statement(s) is/are correct?\na) Only one\nb) Only two\nc) All three\nd) None of the aboveARAM IAS ACADEMY\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Doldrums is a low-pressure area characterized by very light and variable winds, resulting\nfrom the convergence of trade winds from both hemispheres.Hence statement 1 is not correct\n\uf0b7 The Doldrums also known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), is marked by calm\nconditions and fluctuating wind patterns, rather than strong prevailing winds. Hence statement\n2 is not correct.\n\uf0b7 This region experiences significant instability and convection, which can foster the development\nof tropical cyclones. The rising warm, moist air in the Doldrums can contribute to cyclone\nformation under favorable conditions. Hence statement 3 is correct.So, option A is correct\n\u0298 Which of the following is not the feature of the Indian Constitution?\na) Doctrine of Separation of Power\nb) Doctrine of Mutual Exclusion in Secularism\nc) Doctrine of Division of Powers\nd) Doctrine of Parliamentary Form of Government\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Indian Constitution ensures that there will be no religion of state but it also ensures to protect\nall religions by state so state is not isolated from religion but protects all religions.\n\uf0b7 The doctrine of mutual exclusion of religion is a concept that refers to the complete separation\nof religion from the state, or the exclusion of religion from state affairs and vice versa. This\nconcept is a feature of the Western concept of secularism, which also includes the following\nprinciples:\n\uf0fc The state and religion have separate spheres of jurisdiction\n\uf0fc The state cannot aid religious institutions\n\uf0fc The state cannot hinder religious communities as long as they follow the law\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following provisions were included in the Constitution of India regarding\ncitizenship at the time of its commencement?ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n1. Citizenship by birth\n2. Citizenship by naturalization\n3. Citizenship by domicile\n4. Citizenship by registration\nSelect the correct answer using the codes below:\na) 1 and 4 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1, 3, and 4 only\nd) 1, 2, 3, and 4\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Constitution of India, at the time of its commencement, provided for various methods of\nacquiring citizenship under Articles 5 to 8. These articles outlined the following provisions for\ncitizenship:\n1. Citizenship by birth (Article 5) \u2013 Any person who was born in the territory of India and met\ncertain conditions at the time of commencement of the Constitution was considered a citizen\nof India.\n2. Citizenship by domicile (Article 5) \u2013 Any person who had their domicile in the territory of\nIndia and met other conditions was entitled to Indian citizenship.\n3. Citizenship by registration (Article 6 and Article 8) \u2013 Certain people, such as those who had\nmigrated from Pakistan or were of Indian origin and residing abroad, could acquire\ncitizenship by registration, provided they met the necessary conditions.\n\uf0b7 However, the Constitution at the time of commencement did not provide for citizenship by\nnaturalization. Naturalization as a mode of acquiring citizenship was later detailed in the\nCitizenship Act of 1955.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following states/union territories have two capitals?\n1. Jammu and Kashmir\n2. Punjab\n3. Chandigarh\n4. Maharashtra\n5. Himachal Pradesh\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below\na) 1, 2 and 3 only\nb) 1, 4 and 5 only\nc) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only\nd) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Himachal Pradesh has two capital Shimla (Summer) and Dharmasala (Winter)\n\uf0b7 Jammu & Kashmir has Srinagar as capital in summer and Jammu in winter.\n\uf0b7 Maharashtra has Mumbai as capital in summer and Nagpur as Capital in winter.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following is not a core element of the Basic Structure Doctrine as articulated by the\nSupreme Court of India?\na) Supremacy of the Constitution\nb) Rule of Law\nc) Fundamental Rights\nd) Division of Power\nAns: C\nExplanation:ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 The Basic Structure Doctrine emerged from the landmark case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of\nKerala (1973).While the Basic Structure Doctrine emphasizes the federal nature of the Indian\npolity, it does not include a unitary nature. The doctrine is designed to protect the essential\nfeatures of the Constitution, including its federal character, which ensures a balance of power\nbetween the central and state governments.\n\uf0b7 Fundamental Right is not a basic structure. That is, it can be amended. However protection of\nfundamental rights is part of Basic structure.\n\uf0b7 Supremacy of constitution, Rule of Law and Division of Powers (Federalism) are part of basic\nstructure.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Assertion (A): Democratic socialism is more compatible with democratic values and institutions than\nstate socialism.\nReason (R): State socialism often involves restrictions on individual liberties and political pluralism in\nthe name of achieving societal goals.\nWhich one of the following is correct?\na) Both A and R are true, and R is the correct explanation of A\nb) Both A and R are true, but R is not the correct explanation of A\nc) A is true, but R is false\nd) A is false, but R is true\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Democratic socialism: It is a political ideology that advocates for a democratic society with a\nsocialist economy. It seeks to balance individual freedom with social equality and economic\njustice. This ideology emphasizes individual liberties, political pluralism and rule of law.\n\uf0b7 State socialism: It often involves a one-party state and a centralized government that exercises\nstrict control over the economy and society. This can lead to restrictions on individual liberties\nand political pluralism. However, such restrictions can undermine democratic values and\ninstitutions.\n\uf0b7 While both ideologies seek to achieve social and economic equality, democratic socialism does so\nwithin a democratic framework that respects individual liberties and political pluralism.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following state has longest land boundary with Myanmar?\na) Nagaland\nb) Arunachal Pradesh\nc) Manipur\nd) Mizoram\nAns: B\nWhy in news: Reconsidering the free movement regime: Home minister\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The FMR allows people living on either side of the border to travel upto 16 km inside each other\u2019s\ncountry without a visa.\n\uf0b7 A border resident needs to have a border pass, valid for a year, to stay in the other country for\nabout two weeks per visit.\n\uf0b7 The FMR also envisaged the promotion of localised border trade through customs stations and\ndesignated markets apart from helping the people of Myanmar access better education and\nhealthcare facilities on the Indian side of the border.\n\uf0b7 Much of India\u2019s present-day northeast was temporarily under Burmese occupation until the\nBritish pushed them out in the 1800s.\n\uf0b7 The victors and the vanquished signed the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, leading to the current\nalignment of the boundary between India and Burma, later renamed Myanmar.\n\uf0b7 The FMR came about in 2018 as part of the Act East policy. The Rohingya refugee crisis that began\nin August 2017 caused the delay.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 Arunachal Pradesh shares the longest border with Myanmar, at 520 km; Nagaland: 215 km,\nManipur: 398 km , Mizoram: 510 km. These four northeastern states of India share a total of 1,643\nkm of border with Myanmar. Hence option-b is correct.\n\uf0b7 Source: https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/reconsidering-the-free-movement-regime-\nexplained/article67773825.ece\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Geographical Indication (GI) tags:\n1. Globally, agricultural products and foodstuffs have the highest share of registered GIs.\n2. India is among the top five countries with highest number of registered GI tags in the world.\n3. GI is governed under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n(TRIPS).\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) 3 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\nAns: C\nWhy in news: Untapped potential- India's two-decade journey with Geographical Indication tags has\nshown limited out-come\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Geographical Indication (GI) is a form of certification that recognises unique products based on\ntheir origin, which is often attributed to agro-climatic variations and traditional cultivation\npractices.\n\uf0b7 This certification is also extended to non-agricultural products, such as handicrafts, based on\nhuman skills, materials and resources available in certain areas that make the product unique.\n\uf0b7 At the level of the World Trade Organization (WTO), GI is governed under the Agreement on\nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Hence statement 3 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Germany leads in GI registrations, with 15,566 registered products, followed by China (7,247), as\nper 2020 data with the World Intellectual Property Organization. Hungary, Czech Republic,\nBulgaria, Italy and Portugal are the next countries in the list. Hence statement 2is incorrect\n\uf0b7 Globally, wines and spirits comprise 51.8 per cent of registered GIs, followed by agricultural\nproducts and foodstuffs at 29.9 per cent. In India, handicraft (about 45 per cent) and agriculture\n(about 30 per cent) comprise the majority of the GI products. Hence statement 1 is incorrect\n\uf0b7 Till December 2023, Intellectual Property India received just 1,167 applications, of which only 547\nproducts have been registered, as per the GI Registry.\n\uf0b7 This means the application acceptance ratio is only about 46 per cent, which indicates that\nregulations are quite strict. It took over a decade for the famous Alphonso mango to receive GI\nregistration due to dis-putes over geography.\n\uf0b7 Trade reforms, legal protection and consumer acceptance are necessary to commercialise local\nproducts and gain premium prices in domestic and international markets.\n\uf0b7 Empirical evidence from many developing and developed countries shows that GI helps economic\nenhancement at the producer\u2019s level. But this is not true to the same extent in India, perhaps due\nto flaws in the GI registration system and market inefficiencies.\n\uf0b7 Therefore, India\u2019s journey of over two decades\u2014the Geographical Indications of Goods\n(Registration and Protection) Rules was enacted in 1999\u2014with GI has had limited outcomes and\nre-quires more popularisation to achieve its full economic potential.\n\uf0b7 The government should incentivise GIs at the initial juncture\u2014at the producers\u2019 level\u2014to boost\nthe numbers. Emphasis should also be on amendment of laws to clearly dictate exclusion of \u201cnon-\nproducers\u201d from benefiting from GIs, and ensure direct benefits to producers.\n\uf0b7 The government\u2019s One District One Product scheme should be integrated with GIs through the\ninvolvement of food producer organisations. Promotion of GI-based products requires special\nemphasis on marketing and branding, which can be resolved to a certain extent by developing\nmarket outlet schemes.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 Source: https://www.downtoearth.org.in/governance/untapped-potential-\n94029#:~:text=Geographical%20Indication%20(GI)%20is%20a,variations%20and%20tradition\nal%20cultivation%20practices.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\nStatement I:\nFor the first time since independence, Lakshadweep has been connected through Submarine Optic\nFiber Cable.\nStatement II:\nDepartment of Tele communications is the Project Executing Agency of Kochi-Lakshadweep Submarine\nOFC Project (KLI project).\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of to the above statements?\na) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for\nStatement-I\nb) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for\nStatement- I\nc) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\nd) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct\nAnswer: C\nWhy in news: Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi inaugurated Kochi-Lakshadweep islands submarine\noptical fiber connection (KLI-SOFC) project.\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Department of Telecommunications (DOT) conceptualized the Kochi-Lakshadweep\nSubmarine OFC Project (KLI project).\n\uf0b7 In the Kochi-Lakshadweep Islands Submarine Cable (KLI) project submarine cable connectivity\nfrom Mainland (Kochi) to eleven Lakshadweep Islands namely, Kavaratti, Agatti, Amini, Kadmat,\nChetlet, Kalpeni, Minicoy, Androth, Kiltan, Bangaram and Bitra has been extended.

It found parts of Tamil Nadu, predominantly the Western Ghats, among the chief\ninvasion hotspots.\n\uf0b7 Recognising the need to combat the menace, Tamil Nadu became the first state in the country to\nunveil its own comprehensive policy, the Tamil Nadu Policy on Invasive Plants and Ecological\nRestoration (TNPIPER), in June 2022. Hence option-c is correct\n\uf0b7 The forest department began removing the top-priority invasive species, prosopisjuliflora, from\nMudumalai Tiger Reserve elephant corridor in the state in 2021\n\uf0b7 The corridor comprises a village on the banks of a Bhavani river tributary, Mayar river and is\nsurrounded by Sathyamangalam in Erode district, a protected area and tiger reserve.\n\uf0b7 The region is bordered by the Western and Eastern Ghats, as well as the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.\nElephants from Nagercoil, Wayanad and Bandipur National Park use this corridor to reach\nBhavanisagar lake and come back.\n\uf0b7 However, eliminating alien species like prosopisjuliflora and lantana camara is not easy, as they\nregrow even after they are removed or burnt. So, it has to be ensured that the model is sustainable\nand maintained in the subsequent years.\n\uf0b7 Alien species often replace native vegetation, altering or degrading natural habitats and reducing\nthe availability of preferred food sources for wildlife.\n\uf0b7 The displacement of native flora by invasive species may also lead to a decline in plant diversity,\naffecting the variety of food resources available for different animal species.\n\uf0b7 It can even alter foraging patterns.

If moisture is added to the air through evaporation, the relative humidity will decrease.\n2. High relative humidity can make the air feel warmer than the actual temperature\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Relative humidity refers to the percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere relative to the\nmaximum amount it can hold at a specific temperature.\n\uf0b7 When moisture is added to the air through evaporation, the relative humidity increases. This is\nbecause relative humidity measures the amount of water vapor in the air compared to the air's\ncapacity to hold moisture at a given temperature. As more moisture is added, the relative\nhumidity rises.Hence statement 1 is not correct\n\uf0b7 High relative humidity impairs the body's ability to cool itself through sweating, which can make\nthe air feel warmer and more uncomfortable than the actual temperature. This occurs because the\nsweat evaporation process, which helps cool the body, is less effective in humid conditions.Hence\nstatement 2 is correct. So, option B is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. Solar radiation is unevenly distributed across the Earth's surface, with the equatorial regions\nreceiving the maximum insolation.\n2. Forests and oceans have higher albedo values than ice caps and deserts.\n3. Melting of polar ice caps decreases the Earth's albedo.\n4. The majority of the heat emitted from the Earth's surface is lost directly to outer space.\nWhich of the above given statement(s) is/are not correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 4 only\nc) 1, 2 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, 3 and 4\nAns: B\nExplanation\n\uf0b7 The equatorial regions experience the highest levels of solar insolation due to the sun being\npositioned almost directly overhead throughout the year. In contrast, the polar regions receive\nless insolation because the sunlight strikes at a much lower angle. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 The melting of polar ice caps reveals darker ocean surfaces, which absorb more sunlight, leading\nto a reduction in the Earth's overall albedo and further warming. Hence, statement 3 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Most of the heat radiated from the Earth's surface is captured and re-emitted by greenhouse gases\nin the atmosphere, rather than escaping directly into space. This trapped heat contributes to the\ngreenhouse effect. Hence, statement 4 is not correct.\n\uf0b7 Albedo is a measure of how much sunlight a surface reflects. Ice caps and deserts have a high\nalbedo, reflecting a significant portion of sunlight, while forests and oceans have a low albedo,\nabsorbing more solar energy. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.So, optionB isthe answer.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. The equatorial regions experience significant temperature variation due to monsoon winds.\n2. The movement of the ITCZ affects the seasonal distribution of rainfall in equatorial regions.\n3. Humidity levels in the equatorial climate are generally low.\nHow many of the above given statement(s) is/are correct?\na) Only one\nb) Only two\nc) All three\nd) None of the above\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Equatorial regions generally have consistent temperatures year-round due to their proximity to\nthe equator. While monsoon winds can influence rainfall patterns, they do not cause significant\ntemperature variations in these regions. Temperatures remain relatively stable, with minor\nvariations. Hence, statement 1 is not correct\n\uf0b7 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), where the trade winds from the Northern and\nSouthern Hemispheres meet, shifts seasonally and impacts the distribution of rainfall. Hence,\nstatement 2 is correct\n\uf0b7 The equatorial climate is known for its high humidity due to the abundant rainfall and consistent\nwarm temperatures. High evaporation rates from oceans and land, combined with frequent\nprecipitation, result in consistently high humidity levels. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.So,\noption A is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 It is an eco-climatic and bio-geographic transition zone in Africa with a semi-arid climate,\nstretching across the south-central latitudes of Northern Africa between the Atlantic Ocean and\nthe Red Sea. This region features flat, barren plains and includes the fertile delta of the Niger,\none of Africa's longest rivers.\nWhich one of the following is the region described in the above paragraph?\na) Sahel\nb) Sahara\nc) Savannah\nd) Ethiopian highlands\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Sahel is an eco-climatic and bio-geographic transition zone in Africa, situated between the\nSahara Desert to the north and the Sudanian savanna to the south. So, option A is the answer.\n\uf0b7 The Sahel features a semi-arid climate and extends across the south-central latitudes of Northern\nAfrica, lying between the Atlantic Ocean and the Red Sea.\n\uf0b7 The name \"Sahel\" is derived from the Arabic word for \"coast\" or \"shore,\" used figuratively to\ndescribe the southern edge of the vast Sahara Desert.\n\uf0b7 The Sahel spans from west to east, encompassing parts of northern Senegal, southern Mauritania,\ncentral Mali, northern Burkina Faso, the extreme south of Algeria, Niger, the northernmost\nregions of Nigeria and Cameroon, the Central African Republic, central Chad, central and southern\nSudan, the extreme north of South Sudan, Eritrea, and the northernmost parts of Ethiopia.\n\uf0b7 The Sahel includes the fertile delta of the Niger River, one of Africa\u2019s longest rivers.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 The region's green vegetation appears only during the rainy season and is often rapidly harvested\nby farmers or consumed by animals.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. Argon is present in higher concentrations than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n2. The concentration of water vapor is highest in the polar regions.\n3. The presence of ozone in the troposphere is beneficial for human health unlike stratospheric\nozone.\nWhich of the above given statement(s) is/are not correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) All the above\nd) None of the above\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Nitrogen and oxygen together make up nearly 99% of clean, dry air. The remaining gases are\nmostly inert and account for about 1% of the atmosphere. Argon comprises approximately 0.93%\nof the Earth's atmosphere, while carbon dioxide makes up about 0.04%. Therefore, argon is\npresent in higher concentrations than carbon dioxide. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Water vapor is one of the most variable gases in the atmosphere. It absorbs long-wave terrestrial\nradiation (infrared or heat emitted by the Earth during the night) and a portion of incoming solar\nradiation.\n\uf0b7 Water vapor is crucial for precipitation and cloud formation. When it condenses, it releases\nlatent heat of condensation, which drives storm activity.\n\uf0b7 The concentration of water vapor is generally highest in the tropical regions, where warmer\ntemperatures allow the air to hold more moisture. In contrast, water vapor levels are lower in the\npolar regions due to colder temperatures, which limit the air's moisture capacity. Hence,\nstatement 2 is not correct.\n\uf0b7 Ozone in the troposphere (ground-level ozone) is harmful to human health, potentially causing\nrespiratory issues and other health problems. In contrast, ozone in the stratosphere (the ozone\nlayer) is beneficial as it shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the\nsun.Hence, statement 3 is not correct. So, option B is the answer.\n\u0298 Which of the following is/are NOT the functions of the Indian Constitution?\n1. It ensures that a dominant group does not misuse its power against others.\n2. It ensures that all the minority groups are not excluded from anything that is available to the\nmajority.\n3.

Another reason why\nwe have a Constitution is precisely to prevent this tyranny or domination by the majority of a\nminority. This can refer to one community dominating another, i.e. inter-community domination,ARAM IAS ACADEMY\nor members of one community dominating others within the same community, i.e. intra-\ncommunity domination.\n\uf0b7 Statement 3 is correct: The Constitution contains lists that detail the issues that each tier of\ngovernment can make laws on. In addition, the Constitution also specifies where each tier of\ngovernment can get the money from for the work that it does. Under federalism, the states are not\nmerely agents of the federal government but draw their authority from the Constitution as well.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option D is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) and Non-\nResident Indians (NRI):\n1. Both NRI and OCI holders have the right to vote in Indian elections.\n2. OCI holders are not eligible to hold constitutional public offices in India but NRI's are eligible to\nhold constitutional and public offices in India.\n3.

Reflects the aspirations of the framers for a just, inclusive, and democratic society.\n2. Declares that the Constitution derives its authority from the people of India.\n3. Acts as a guiding framework for interpreting fundamental rights and constitutional amendments\nwithout being justiciable in itself.\n4. Enshrines the values of justice, liberty, equality, and fraternity.\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below:\na) 1, 2, and 4 only\nb) 2, 3, and 4 only\nc) 1, 3, and 4 only\nd) 1, 2, 3, and 4\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1 is Correct: The Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala (1973)\ncase held that the Preamble reflects the philosophy and intent of the framers of the Constitution.\nIt was affirmed that the basic structure doctrine includes the vision of justice, equality, liberty,\nand fraternity, as outlined in the Preamble, which cannot be amended.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2 is Correct: The Preamble begins with the words \"We, the people of India,\"\nemphasizing that the sovereignty of the nation resides with its citizens. This shows that the\nultimate source of power is the people, and it is through their will that the Constitution comes into\nexistence. It is a cornerstone of democratic governance.\n\uf0b7 Statement 3 is Correct: The Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala (1973)\ncase held that the Preamble is part of the Constitution and can be used to interpret constitutional\nprovisions. However, it is not enforceable in itself but acts as a guiding light for interpreting laws\nand rights.\n\uf0b7 Statement 4 is Correct: The core principles in the Preamble \u2014 justice (social, economic, and\npolitical), liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith, and worship, equality of status and\nopportunity, and fraternity \u2014 represent the essence of the Indian constitutional framework.\nThese principles are mirrored in various parts of the Constitution.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option D is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following statements ensure \"the Republic\" nature of Indian constitution?\n1. The President of India is directly elected by an Electoral College for a fixed term.\n2. The President of India holds real executive power and is the chief decision-maker.\n3. The Republic status of India reflects the principle that the ultimate sovereignty rests with the\npeople, and all public offices, including the head of state, are thrown open to all citizens.\nSelect the answer using the codes given below:\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 1 and 3 only\nc) 3 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1 is Incorrect. As per Article 54, the President of India is elected indirectly by an\nElectoral College consisting of members of Parliament and the Legislative Assemblies of States\nand Union Territories. The President serves for a fixed term of five years as provided under\nArticle 56.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2 is Incorrect: In India\u2019s parliamentary system, the President (head of state) holds a\nceremonial position, while the real executive power lies with the Council of Ministers headed by\nthe Prime Minister. This is affirmed by Article 74, which mandates that the President must act on\nthe advice of the Council of Ministers.\n\uf0b7 Statement 3 is Correct: The term \"Republic\" indicates that sovereignty rests with the people, and\nall public offices are filled through elections, rather than being based on hereditary rule. It doesn\u2019t\nspecifically guarantee equal participation through universal adult suffrage, but it does ensure thatARAM IAS ACADEMY\npositions of authority, such as the President, are elected by the people or their representatives.\nThus, the concept of the Republic in India emphasizes elected positions and people's sovereignty.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. Parliamentary sovereignty implies that the legislative body holds the supreme power to enact or\nrepeal any law, without being limited by any higher authority, whereas popular sovereignty\nemphasizes that ultimate power rests with the people.\n2. The principle of democracy in the Preamble is directly connected to the idea of popular\nsovereignty, which reflects the power vested in the people.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Parliamentary sovereignty: It refers to the concept where the legislative body (Parliament)\nholds the supreme power to enact or repeal any law, without being limited by any higher\nauthority (e.g., UK).\n\uf0b7 Popular sovereignty: The ultimate authority rests with the people, who exercise their power\nthrough elected representatives (as seen in a democracy like India). The Preamble of India\nreflects the idea of popular sovereignty by beginning with \"We, the people of India.\"\n\uf0b7 The Preamble's mention of democracy emphasizes that power resides with the people, who\nelect their representatives to govern on their behalf. This concept of popular sovereignty is a\ncore principle of a democratic system, ensuring that the government operates with the consent of\nthe governed.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, which of the following are prohibited from\nreceiving foreign funds?\n1.

Their honey, which is\nrunny enough to be drunk like a liquid and is said to have a citrusy aftertaste, is used by many\nIndigenous Peruvians as a natural medicine.\n\uf0b7 The Amazon is home to hundreds of species of stingless bee, but as deforestation converts the\ntropical landscape into farms and ranches, these and other native pollinators are in danger of\ndisappearing. Hence option-b is correct.\n\uf0b7 Pesticides, climate change and competition with the honeybee, which is better adapted to\nagricultural areas than the stingless bee, introduces more strain.\n\uf0b7 Building an economy around stingless bees, which pollinate much of the Amazon\u2019s native flora, is a\ncreative way to fight deforestation.\n\uf0b7 The Amazon is one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. But widespread deforestation\nthreatens the protection of Indigenous communities as well as the animals and plants that live\nthere, and it reduces the habitat\u2019s function as a major carbon sink amid Earth\u2019s growing climate\ncrisis.\n\uf0b7 Source: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/30/science/amazon-stingless-bees-honey.html\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding World Employment and Social Outlook released\nby International Labour Organisation\u2019s (ILO):\n1. Both the number of workers living in extreme poverty and those living in moderate poverty went\nup.\n2. The global unemployment rate had reduced compared to the previous year.\n3. Only India, China and the Russian Federation enjoyed positive real wage growth among the G20\ncountries.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1, 2 and 3\nb) 1 and 3 onlyARAM IAS ACADEMY\nc) 2 and 3 only\nd) 1 and 2 only\nAns: D\nWhy in news: ILO sees structural imbalances in global labour market\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Global unemployment rate is set to increase in 2024 while growing social inequalities remain a\nconcern, said the International Labour Organisation\u2019s (ILO) World Employment and Social\nOutlook: Trends 2024\n\uf0b7 2024 (WESO Trends) revealed that the global unemployment rate hit 5.1% in 2023, lower than\nthe 5.3% in 2022.Hence statement 2 is correct.\n\uf0b7 In 2023, the number of workers living in extreme poverty grew by about one million, while those\nliving in moderate poverty went up by 8.4 million. Hence statement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 The jobs gap rate was also higher for lower-income nations with 20.5% in 2023, while it was at\n8.2% higher-income countries.\n\uf0b7 Real wage declined in the majority of G20 countries as wage increase was not proportionate to\ninflation growth. Only China, the Russian Federation, and Mexico enjoyed positive real wage\ngrowth in 2023.India did not enjoy positive growth.

This wind is known for its ability to carry fine dust and sand\nparticles, significantly impacting air quality and weather conditions in the regions it affects. It is\nparticularly notable for its influence on the weather in countries such as Italy and Greece. The\nrainfall from this wind is also known as \"blood rain\".\nWhich one of the following is the wind described in the above paragraph?\na) Mistral\nb) Sirocco\nc) Harmattan\nd) Bora\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Sirocco is a Mediterranean wind that comes from the Sahara and reaches hurricane speeds in\nNorth Africa and Southern Europe.\n\uf0b7 It arises from a warm, dry, tropical air mass that is pulled northward by low-pressure cells\nmoving eastward across the Mediterranean Sea, with the wind originating in the Arabian or\nSahara deserts. The hotter, drier continental air mixes with the cooler, wetter air of the maritime\ncyclone, and the counter-clockwise circulation of the low propels the mixed air across the\nsouthern coasts of Europe.\n\uf0b7 The Sirocco causes dusty dry conditions along the northern coast of Africa, storms in the\nMediterranean Sea, and cool wet weather in Europe.\n\uf0b7 The amount of red sand is also high along with the sirocco air. When these winds pass through the\nMediterranean, they pick up moisture and sometimes provide rainfall in southern Italy. When the\nred sand starts settling down, it seems that blood rain is happening.\n\uf0b7 So, option B is the answer.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. During the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the Northern Hemisphere experiences\nits longest day and shortest night.\n2. During the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere experiences its\nlongest day and shortest night.\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are not correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The summer solstice occurs when one of the Earth\u2019s poles (North pole) has its maximum tilt\ntoward the Sun.\n\uf0b7 The winter solstice occurs when one of the Earth\u2019s poles (North Pole) has its maximum tilt away\nfrom the Sun.\n\uf0b7 The summer solstice brings the longest day in the Northern Hemisphere, as it is tilted towards the\nsun.Winter solstice brings the longest night in the Northern Hemisphere as it is tilted away from\nthe sun. Hence, both the statements are correct. So, option D is the answer.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Land breeze:\n1. It generally has higher humidity level than sea breeze.\n2. It occurs because the land radiates heat faster than water at night, cooling more quickly.\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are not correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Land breezes generally have lower humidity compared to sea breezes. Sea breezes bring moist,\nhumid air from the ocean towards the land, while land breezes, coming from the cooler and drier\nland, move towards the sea, carrying less moisture.Hence, statement 1 is not correct.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 At night, the land cools down faster than the water, causing the air over the land to cool and\nbecome denser, forming a high-pressure zone. The warmer air over the sea rises, creating lower\npressure, and this pressure difference drives the cooler land air towards the sea, forming a land\nbreeze. Hence, statement 2 is correct.So, option A is the answer.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. Low-altitude clouds have a high albedo.\n2. Stratus clouds are low-altitude clouds.\nWhich of the above given statement(s) is/are correct?\na) 1only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) None of the above\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Low-level clouds are clouds that occur below 6,500 feet and are made of liquid water droplets or\nsupercooled droplets\n\uf0b7 The two main types of low clouds include stratus, which develop horizontally, andcumulus, which\ndevelop vertically.\n\uf0b7 Low-altitude clouds have a high albedo because they are thicker and reflect more solar radiation\nback into space than high cloud.Low-altitude clouds, such as stratus and cumulus clouds having\nhigh albedo, reflect a large portion of incoming solar radiation back into space, helping to cool the\nEarth. Hence, statement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Stratus clouds are typically found at low altitudes, close to the Earth's surface. They often appear\nas a uniform layer of grey clouds covering the sky Hence, statement 2 is correct\n\uf0b7 So, option C is the answer.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\nStatement \u2013 I:\nTemperate cyclone originates between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 latitudes in both the hemispheres.\nStatement \u2013 II:\nTemperate cyclones are fuelled by the release of latent heat from warm ocean watersARAM IAS ACADEMY\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\na) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct, and Statement \u2013 II is the correct explanation for\nStatement-I\nb) Both Statement \u2013 I and Statement-II are correct, and Statement-II is not the correct explanation\nfor Statement-I\nc) Statement-I is correct, but Statement-II is incorrect\nd) Statement-I is incorrect, but Statement-II is correct\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Temperate cyclones, also referred to as mid-latitude cyclones, typically develop between the\nlatitudes of 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 in both hemispheres These cyclones are low-pressure systems that\nfeature cold fronts, warm fronts, and occluded fronts. They form along the polar front, where cold\npolar air converges with warmer tropical air, creating atmospheric instability. Hence statement\n1 is correct\n\uf0b7 The main factor behind the formation of temperate cyclones is the interaction between cold polar\nair and warm tropical air, resulting in the creation of a frontal zone. While the release of latent\nheat from warm ocean waters can enhance the intensity of a temperate cyclone after it has\nformed, it is not the primary factor driving its formation.Hence, statement 2 is also correct but\nStatement 2 doesnot explain statement 1.So, option B is the answer.\n\u0298 Which of the following statements is correct with reference to the bifurcation of Jammu &\nKashmir into Union Territories?\na) The bifurcation was done under Article 3 without needing a constitutional amendment.\nb) Article 370 had to be necessarily be fully abrogated before the bifurcation process could be\ninitiated.\nc) The state of Jammu & Kashmir was bifurcated under Article 2 of the Constitution.\nd) Consent of the dissolved Jammu & Kashmir Legislative Assembly was obtained before bifurcation.\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1 is correct: The bifurcation of Jammu & Kashmir into two Union Territories\u2014\nJammu & Kashmir, and Ladakh\u2014was carried out using the provisions of Article 3 of the Indian\nConstitution. It is outside article 368 and therefore not deemed constitutional amendment.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2: The Parliament is provided sovereign power to alter the boundary of the state of\nreadjustment of the political map of India. Thus Article 370 is not needed to be abrogated for the\nbifurcationARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 Statement 3: Article 2 is regarding admission of new states into the Union. It has no relevance in\nthe bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\uf0b7 Statement 4: AT the event of bifurcation the assembly of Jammu and Kashmir was dissolved and\nthe consent was not obtained.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following best reflects the difference between equality and equity in the Indian\ncontext?\na) Equality focuses on equal treatment, while equity focuses on fairness justice and addressing\ndisadvantages.\nb) Equality is a constitutional mandate, whereas equity is an administrative policy.\nc) Equality ensures equal outcomes for all, while equity focuses on ensuring equal starting points.\nd) Equality is concerned with political rights, whereas equity is concerned with economic rights.\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Equality: The concept of equality is primarily enshrined in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.\nThis provision guarantees formal equality, meaning that all individuals must be treated equally\nby the law. This principle ensures that every individual, irrespective of caste, religion, or gender,\nis subject to the same laws, ensuring uniform treatment.\n\uf0b7 Equity: Equity, on the other hand, focuses on substantive equality \u2014 the idea of ensuring\nfairness by addressing historical disadvantages and systemic barriers. This concept is\nreflected in the affirmative action provisions like e.g., reservations under Articles 15(4) and\n16(4), aiming to bring marginalized groups to an equal footing with the rest of society.\n\uf0b7 In essence, equality gives everyone the same starting line, but equity takes into account\nhistorical and social disadvantages and provides extra support to bring people to a comparable\nlevel, thus ensuring fairness.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA):\n1. The CAA provides a pathway to Indian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities from\nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.\n2. The CAA does not apply to areas covered under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, including\ntribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1: Correct. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) provides a fast-track path to\nIndian citizenship for persecuted religious minorities (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis,\nand Christians) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. However, these individuals must\nhave entered India on or before December 31, 2014. This amendment specifically excludes\nMuslims from these countries.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2: Correct. The CAA does not apply to certain areas in the Northeast. These include the\ntribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura as mentioned in the Sixth Schedule\nof the Constitution. The law also excludes areas that fall under the Inner Line Permit (ILP)\nsystem, which includes Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Mizoram.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Which one of the following statements is/are correct regarding amendability of Preamble?\n1. It cannot be amended under Article 368 of the Constitution.\n2. The Preamble has been amended twice so far.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n3. Preamble can be amended without altering the \u2018basic features\u2019\nSelect the correct answer using the code given below.\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 3 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\nAns: C\nExplanation\n\uf0b7 KesavanandaBharaticase (1973):The question as to whether the Preamble can be amended\nunder Article 368 of the Constitution arose for the first time in the historic Kesavananda\nBharaticase (1973).Supreme court held that:\n\uf0fc Preamble can be amended; subject to the condition that no amendment is done to the \u2018basic\nfeatures\u2019.\n\uf0fc But Fundamental features of the Constitution as contained in the Preamble cannot be altered\nby an amendment under Article 368.\n\uf0b7 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act\n\uf0fc The Preamble has been amended only once, in 1976, by the 42nd Constitutional\nAmendment Act.\n\uf0fc It has added three new words\u2013Socialist, Secular and Integrity\u2013to the Preamble. This\namendment was held to be valid.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct\n\u0298 Which of the following best defines the concept of Constitutional Morality?\na) Constitutional Morality refers to adherence to the values, rules, and principles enshrined in the\nConstitution, even if they conflict with prevailing social customs and traditions.\nb) Constitutional Morality is the practice of upholding societal norms and values, ensuring that all\nlaws are in harmony with the majority's cultural and religious beliefs.\nc) Constitutional Morality ensures that the Legislature and Executive can impose restrictions on\nFundamental Rights based on public opinion and morality.\nd) Constitutional Morality emphasizes the unrestricted power of the Judiciary to enforce laws\naccording to societal traditions.\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Constitutional Morality emphasizes the importance of upholding the principles of the\nConstitution, such as liberty, equality, and justice, even when they conflict with societal norms,\ncultural traditions, or public morality. The doctrine prioritizes the progressive and inclusive\nnature of the Constitution, ensuring that individual rights are safeguarded, and the rule of law\nprevails. It often comes into play in judicial decisions when constitutional principles may\nchallenge entrenched social practices (e.g., Sabarimala case, decriminalization of Section 377).\n\uf0b7 Statement 2: Constitutional morality is neither based on culture or religion nor seek to pacify all\nreligion. It is upholding constitutional norms.\n\uf0b7 Statement 3: Constitutional morality seeks to bring in constitutionalism and thus restricts the\npower of legislature and executive.\n\uf0b7 Statement 4: Constitutional morality is also embodies separation of power and thus goes against\nthe concept of judicial supremacy.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 With reference to semiconductor industry in India, which of the following is the main strength\nand advantage that India currently possesses over other countries?\na) Ability to produce complete chip indigenously\nb) Large talent pool of design engineers.\nc) Raw material source of semiconductors\nd) Both (a) and (b)\nAnswer: BARAM IAS ACADEMY\nWhy in news: India's semiconductor mission focused on designing entire chip: Vaishnaw\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Union minister recently said that \u201cThe biggest priority is on design that's where we have a very\nbig strength.\n\uf0b7 In design, we are advancing from being a back office to actually producing the complete chip or\nrather designing the complete chip, two going out to the customers taking the concept and then\ndeveloping the entire chip.Hence option-a is incorrect\n\uf0b7 The second big focus for us is to make sure that talent for all parts of the ecosystem gets\ndeveloped and in that, it's very important to continuously upgrade the course curriculums.\n\uf0b7 It is very important to make sure that we are connected with the companies that are working on it.\n\uf0b7 Union minster Vaishnaw called India the right place for developing semiconductors as the country\nhas a large pool of talent, which includes close to 300,000 design engineers who practically design\nevery complex chip which is manufactured in the world.Hence option-b is correct\n\uf0b7 But main challenges to this mission are India does not have semiconductor raw materials in\nabundance within the country and dependence is on China for most of the raw materials.Hence\noption-c is incorrect.\n\uf0b7 Source: https://www.business-standard.com/india-news/india-s-semiconductor-mission-\nfocused-on-designing-entire-chip-vaishnaw-124011800042_1.html\n\u0298 The Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), which will be the world\u2019s most advanced and capable\nground-based optical, near-infrared, and mid-infrared observatory is a partnership project\nbetween how many of the following?\n1.

Hence statement-I is correct\n\uf0b7 The lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries use liquid electrolytes.\n\uf0b7 The focus should be on mass-production of new materials and establishing a supply chain for solid\nelectrolytes, which hold the key to the commercialisation of solid-state batteries\n\uf0b7 The electrolyte is solid. This allows ions, which convey electricity, to move faster, thus enabling\nshorter charging times, increased cruising ranges, and produce higher power output.\n\uf0b7 Toyota expects its electric cars powered by them to have a range of 1,200km - over twice that of\nthe current range of electric vehicles (EVs) \u2014 and a charging time of 10 minutes or less, far lower\nthan that two-four hours that it takes to fast charge an EV with Li-ion batteries.\n\uf0b7 It is highly stable because they are resistant to changes in temperature and can robustly endure\nhigh temperatures and high voltages.\n\uf0b7 It is much safer than lithium-ion batteries from fire and explosion.\n\uf0b7 Crucially, though, solid electrolytes are less dense, so a solid-state battery can be smaller and\nlighter than its lithium-ion competitor. Hence statement -III is incorrect\n\uf0b7 Disadvantage: The extreme sensitivity of the batteries to moisture and oxygen, as well as the\nmechanical pressure needed to hold them together to prevent the formation of dendrites, the\nmetal filaments that can cause short circuits.

When would be the most advantageous time for the resort to\nschedule outdoor events to maximize the benefit of mountain breezes for cooling?\na) Early evening\nb) Midday\nc) Late morning\nd) Late nightARAM IAS ACADEMY\nAns:A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Mountain breezes, or katabatic winds, form when cooler, denser air from higher elevations flows\ndown into the valleys. This movement is driven by the temperature contrast between the cooler\nmountain slopes and the warmer valley areas. They typically occur in the late afternoon or early\nevening when the slopes of the mountain begin to cool faster than the surrounding air. The cooler,\ndenser air descends into the valleys, creating a natural cooling effect. This makes early evening\nthe best time to experience these breezes.\nSo, option A is the answer.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. The Coriolis force is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator.\n2. The Coriolis force acts parallel to the pressure gradient force\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are not correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Earth's rotation on its axis influences wind direction, and this effect is known as the Coriolis\nforce. The force is directly related to the latitude, with winds being deflected to the left in the\nSouthern Hemisphere and to the right in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\uf0b7 The Coriolis force is maximum at the poles due to the Earth\u2019s rotation and is zero at the Equator.\nThe force arises because of the Earth's rotation and is proportional to the rotational velocity,\nwhich is highest at the poles and zero at the Equator.Hence statement 1 is correct\n\uf0b7 The Coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force (pressure gradient force is\nperpendicular to an isobar)and is directly proportional to the angle of latitude. It is maximum at\nthe poles and is absent at the equator. Hence statement 2 is not correct.So, option B is the\nanswer.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 With reference to the structure of the atmosphere, consider the following statements:\n1. The stratosphere is characterized by a temperature inversion, where temperature increases with\naltitude.\n2. The thermosphere is the layer where most of the atmospheric weather phenomena occur.\n3. The ionosphere, which is part of the thermosphere, plays a key role in radio wave propagation.\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Stratosphere lies beyond troposphere, up to an altitude of 50 km from the earth\u2019s surface.\n\uf0b7 The temperature in this layer remains constant for some distance but then increases with altitude\ndue to the absorption of ultraviolet (UV) radiation by the ozone layer.This rise is due to the\npresence of ozone (harmful ultraviolet radiation is absorbed by ozone).Hence, statement 1 is\ncorrect\n\uf0b7 Stratosphere is almost free from clouds and associated weather phenomenon, making conditions\nmost ideal for flying aeroplanes\n\uf0b7 In thermosphere temperature rises very rapidly with increasing height.Ionosphere is a part of this\nlayer. It extends between 80-400 km.This layer helps in radio transmission. In fact, radio waves\ntransmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer.Most atmospheric weather\nphenomena occur in the troposphere, not the thermosphere.Hence statement 2 is not correct\nbut statement 3 is correct.So, option C is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\n+\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. The subtropical high-pressure belts are characterized by relatively cooler temperatures\ncompared to the tropical regions.\n2. Most of the deserts are present along subtropical high-pressure belts in both the hemispheres.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The sub-tropical highs extend from near the tropics to about 35\u00b0N and S.\n\uf0b7 How it is formed?\n\uf0fc After saturation (complete loss of moisture) at the ITCZ, the air moving away from equatorial\nlow-pressure belt in the upper troposphere becomes dry and cold.\n\uf0fc This dry and cold wind subsides at 30\u00b0N and S.\n\uf0fc So the high pressure along this belt is due to subsidence of air coming from the equatorial\nregion which descends after becoming heavy.\n\uf0fc The high pressure is also due to the blocking effect of air at upper levels because of the Coriolis\nforce.\n\uf0b7 The subsiding air is warm and dry, therefore, most of the deserts are present along this belt, in\nboth hemispheres.Hence, statement 2 is correct\n\uf0b7 The subtropical high-pressure belts are characterized by relatively higher temperatures, not\ncooler. These belts are formed due to descending air from the Hadley cells, which leads to warmer\ntemperatures and dry conditions.Hence statement 1 is not correct.So, option B is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 Katabatic winds are\na) Winds flowing uphill due to differential heating of the Earth's surface\nb) Winds flowing down slopes due to gravity\nc) Winds associated with cyclones\nd) Winds causing significant temperature rise in desert regions\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Katabatic winds are downslope winds, formed by cold, dense air descending from higher\nelevations due to gravity. They are often observed at night or during winter when the air near\nmountain tops cools rapidly. So, option B is correct.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 The 'quasi-federal' nature of the Indian Constitution is most evident in:\na) The supremacy of the Constitution\nb) The division of powers between Centre and States\nc) The bicameral nature of the Parliament\nd) The independent judiciary\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The 'quasi-federal' nature of the Indian Constitution is most prominently reflected in the division\nof powers between the Centre and the States. This feature encapsulates the essence of India's\nunique federal structure, which is neither purely federal nor entirely unitary.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. Negative liberty tradition argues for an inviolable area of non-interference in which the individual\ncan express himself or herself.\n2. Positive liberty is concerned with looking at the conditions and nature of the relationship\nbetween the individual and society and of improving these conditions such that there are fewer\nconstraints to the development of the individual personality\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1: \u2018Negative liberty\u2019 seeks to define and defend an area in which the individual would\nbe inviolable, in which he or she could \u2018do, be or become\u2019 whatever he or she wished to \u2018do, be or\nbecome\u2019. This is an area in which no external authority can interfere. It is a minimum area that is\nsacred and in which whatever the individual does, is not to be interfered with. The existence of\nthe \u2018minimum area of non-interference\u2019 is the recognition that human nature and human dignity\nneed an area where the person can act unobstructed by others. How big should this area be, or\nwhat should it contain, are matters of discussion, and will continue to be matters of debate since\nthe bigger the area of non-interference the more the freedom.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2: Positive liberty recognises that one can be free only in society (not outside it) and\nhence tries to make that society such that it enables the development of the individual whereasARAM IAS ACADEMY\nnegative liberty is only concerned with the inviolable area of non-interference and not with the\nconditions in society, outside this area, as such.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following could not be construed as a reason for the lengthiness of the Indian\nConstitution?\na) Diversity of the country\nb) Republican Polity\nc) Single Constitution for both the Centre and the states\nd) Dominance of legal luminaries in the Constituent Assembly.\nAns: B\nExplanation\n\uf0b7 Size of the population does not matter for the provisions of the Constitution. Lesser or larger the\npopulation, the law remains the same.\n\uf0b7 The Constitution of India is the lengthiest of all the written constitutions of the world. It is a very\ncomprehensive, elaborate and detailed document. Four factors have contributed to the\nelephantine size of our Constitution. They are:\n(a) Geographical factors, that is, the vastness of the country and its diversity.\n(b) Historical factors, e.g., the influence of the Government of India Act of 1935, which was bulky.\n(c) Single Constitution for both the Centre and the states except Jammu and Kashmir.\n(d) Dominance of legal luminaries in the Constituent Assembly.\n\uf0b7 The republican polity does not needs an lengthy constitution as many republican country has\nshortest constitution.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.\n\u0298 A foreign national, Mr. John, has been residing in India for the past 14 years on a valid work\nvisa.

He is now interested in applying for Indian citizenship.\nBased on the Citizenship Act of 1955, which of the following options applies to Mr. John's\nsituation regarding the process of naturalisation or registration for obtaining Indian\ncitizenship?\n1. Mr. John is eligible for naturalisation as he has resided in India for more than the required period.\n2. Mr. John must renounce his foreign citizenship before applying for Indian citizenship.\n3. Mr. John can only apply for citizenship through registration as a person of Indian origin.\nWhich of the following options is correct?\na) Only statement 1 is correct\nb) Statements 1 and 2 are correct\nc) Statements 2 and 3 are correct\nd) All statements are correct\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1 is correct: Under the Citizenship Act, Mr. John is eligible for naturalisation as he has\nresided in India for more than 12 years.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2 is correct: According to the Citizenship Act, a foreign national must renounce their\noriginal citizenship upon acquiring Indian citizenship.\n\uf0b7 Statement 3 is incorrect: Mr. John cannot apply for citizenship through registration as a person of\nIndian origin unless he fulfills specific criteria, which may not apply to him.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\nStatement 1:\nThe government is one element of the State.\nStatement 2:\nThe State refers to more than just the government and cannot be used interchangeably with it.\nIdentify the correct statement from the options below:\na) Statement 1 and statement 2 is correct and statement 2 is the correct explanation of statement 1\nb) Statement 1 and statement 2 is correct and statement 2 is not the correct explanation of\nstatement 1\nc) Statement 1 is correct, statement 2 is incorrect\nd) Statement 1 is incorrect, statement 2 is correct\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1 is correct as Government is an element of state.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2 is also correct as state encompasses wider areas merely Government. Thus\ngovernment and state is not same.\n\uf0b7 However Governance as an element of State is explained by the second statement.\n\uf0b7 In political science, the government refers to the organized system of authority that enacts laws,\npolicies, and regulations, and administers public affairs. It is composed of elected officials and\npublic servants who make decisions, implement laws, and govern the populace. The government\ncan change through elections, appointments, or other means, but the State persists over time.\n\uf0b7 The State encompasses a broader framework than the government alone. The State is defined as a\npolitical entity that consists of several key components:\n1. Territory: The geographical area under the jurisdiction of the State.\n2. Population: The people residing within that territory, regardless of their citizenship status.\n3. Sovereignty: The ultimate authority of the State to govern itself and make decisions without\nexternal interference.\n4. Institutions: Various organizations and entities that operate within the State, including the\njudiciary, military, and civil service, in addition to the government.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 With reference to Nuclear power in India, consider the following statements:\nStatement I:\nRadioactivity concentrations in air, water and land around the country\u2019s existing nuclear power plants\nare below international discharge limits.\nStatement II:\nNuclear power might play an essential role in producing green hydrogen, contributing to global efforts\nto achieve a cleaner energy transition.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of to the above statements?\na) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for\nStatement-I\nb) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for\nStatement- I\nc) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\nd) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct\nAns: B\nWhy in news:Radioactivity concentrations in ecology around India\u2019s nuclear power plants minimal,\nbelow international limits: BARC study\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 In what could reinforce India\u2019s commitment to advance nuclear power programme safely as part\nof its long-term goal to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, a group of scientists from the Bhabha\nAtomic Research Centre (BARC) has found that the radioactivity concentrations in air, water and\nland around the country\u2019s existing nuclear power plants are not only minimal but also below\ninternational discharge limits. Hence statement-I is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 Published last week in journal Science Direct, the findings acknowledge that though nuclear\npower plants release some radioactivity into the environment through various pathways and in\ndifferent forms, these discharges are carefully managed through planned programmes of dilution\nand dispersion, adhering to strict radiological and environmental regulatory regimes.\n\uf0b7 Though nuclear power plants have been safely operated in many developed countries for a long\ntime, they have encountered significant challenges due to the fear of radiation. Such fears\nintensified after past incidents at Three Mile Island (USA), Chernobyl (Ukraine) and Fukushima\n(Japan).\n\uf0b7 India's Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is on a mission to commission a\nnuclear power reactor every year, as nuclear power might play an essential role in producing\ngreen hydrogen, contributing to global efforts to achieve a cleaner energy transition.

Auroras occur mainly in the polar regions due to the concentration of Earth's magnetic field lines.\n2. Auroras can only be observed during periods of solar flares.\nWhich of the statement(s) given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns:A\nWhy in news?\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Aurora are captivating natural lights, known for their bright, swirling curtain-like appearance in\nthe night sky, display a spectrum of colors such as blue, red, yellow, green, and orange.\n\uf0b7 While they predominantly occur near the poles in both the northern and southern hemispheres,\nthey occasionally extend to lower latitudes.\n\uf0b7 Referred to as the aurora borealis in the northern hemisphere and aurora australis in the\nsouthern hemisphere, these lights can be observed throughout the year.\n\uf0b7 The phenomenon occurs due to solar activity. The Sun continuously emits charged particles,\nprimarily electrons and protons, along with magnetic fields, in what is known as the solar wind.\nHence statement 1 is correct\n\uf0b7 As this solar wind nears Earth, the planet's magnetic field deflects most of it, acting as a protective\nbarrier. However, some charged particles become trapped in the magnetic field and travel along\nits lines towards the Earth's north and south poles, entering the upper atmosphere.\n\uf0b7 When these particles interact with atmospheric gases, they create tiny flashes that illuminate the\nnight sky. Collisions with oxygen result in green light, while interactions with nitrogen produce\nblue and purple hues.\n\uf0b7 Auroras are not limited to solar flares; they can occur during regular solar wind activity, though\nthey are more intense during solar storms. Hence statement 2 is not correct.So option A is\ncorrectARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 Which of the following is unlikely to be a reason for reduced rainfall in North Eastern India?\na) The changes in the Indian Ocean temperature\nb) Reduction in the vegetation area in northeast India\nc) Increase in cropland Area\nd) None of the above\nAns:D\nWhy in news?\nExplanation:\nFactors contributing to the decreasing trend in rainfall include:\n\uf0b7 Temperature Variations: Fluctuations in the temperature of the Indian Ocean significantly\ninfluence rainfall patterns in the Northeast region.\n\uf0b7 Decline in Vegetation Cover: Analysis of satellite data indicates a decrease in vegetation cover in\nNortheast India, leading to altered rainfall patterns.\n\uf0b7 Expansion of Agricultural Land and Deforestation: Practices such as jhum cultivation (shifting\ncultivation) have resulted in deforestation and an increase in cropland area, further affecting\nrainfall.\n\uf0b7 So, all are reasons, Hence, option D is the answer.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements:\n1. A cloudburst is a sudden, intense rainfall event where a significant amount of precipitation often\nmore than 100 mm occurs in a short period, typically less than an hour, over a localized area.\n2. In India, cloudbursts often occur during the monsoon season.\n3. Cloudburst events are associated with cumulonimbus clouds.\nWhich of the above given statement(s) is/are not correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 onlyARAM IAS ACADEMY\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) None of the above\nAns: D\nWhy in news?\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 A cloudburst is an extreme amount of precipitation, sometimes with hail and thunder, which\nnormally lasts no longer than a few minutes but is capable of creating flood conditions.\n\uf0b7 A cloudburst is an extreme weather event characterized by an intense and sudden downpour of\nrainfall in a very short duration, usually within an hour or less. During a cloudburst, the amount of\nrainfall can exceed 100 millimeters (mm) over a very small, localized area, making it significantly\nmore concentrated than regular rain showers.\n\uf0b7 There is no satisfactory technique for anticipating the occurrence of cloud bursts because they\ndevelop over a small period of time. Since they are not predictable and take place over a small\narea, it is advisable to take necessary precautions before the cloudburst Hence statement 1 is\ncorrect\n\uf0b7 In India, cloudburst occurs in states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir. It\nis a common phenomenon in Himalayan areas, especially in Garhwal and Kumaon Himalayas. It is\nduring the monsoons that they hit the hardest. Hence statement 2 is correct\n\uf0b7 Cloudburst events are often associated with cumulonimbus clouds that cause thunderstorms and\noccasionally due to monsoon wind surges. Cloudburst occurs when moisture-rich air travels up a\nmountainous region, forming a vertical column of clouds known as Cumulonimbus clouds. These\nclouds usually cause rain, thunder and lightning. Hence statement 3 is correct. So, option D is\nthe answer.\n\u0298 These are colourful clouds featuring clusters of small white flakes or round particles, organized\nin a distinct wavelike formation known as a mackerel sky. They typically resemble ripples,\nsimilar to sand ripples found in deserts.\nIn this context, which type of clouds best fits the description provided above?\na) Cirrocumulus clouds\nb) Stratocumulus clouds\nc) Altocumulus clouds\nd) Cirrostratus clouds\nAns: A\nExplanation:\nCirrocumulus clouds\n\uf0b7 They are thin, white patch, sheet, or layered of clouds without shading and they are composed of\nvery small elements in the form of more or less regularly arranged grains or ripples.\n\uf0b7 Cirrocumulus cloudsare coloured clouds having patches of small white flakes or small round\nparticles and these are arranged in a distinct group for wave like form called mackerel sky.Hence,\noption A is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\nHigh clouds:\n\uf0b7 High clouds occur above about 20,000 feet and are given the prefix \u201ccirro.\u201d Due to cold\ntropospheric temperatures at these levels, the clouds primarily are composed of ice crystals, and\noften appear thin, streaky, and white (although a low sun angle, e.g., near sunset, can create an\narray of color on the clouds).\n\uf0b7 The three main types of high clouds are cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus.\n\uf0b7 Cirrus clouds are wispy, feathery, and composed entirely of ice crystals. They often are the first\nsign of an approaching warm front or upper-level jet streak.Unlike cirrus, cirrostratus clouds form\nmore of a widespread, veil-like layer (similar to what stratus clouds do in low levels).\n\uf0b7 When sunlight or moonlight passes through the hexagonalshaped ice crystals of cirrostratus\nclouds, the light is dispersed or refracted (similar to light passing through a prism) in such a way\nthat a familiar ring or halo may form.\n\uf0b7 As a warm front approaches, cirrus clouds tend to thicken into cirrostratus, which may, in turn,\nthicken and lower into altostratus, stratus, and even nimbostratus.\n\uf0b7 Finally, cirrocumulus clouds are layered clouds permeated with small cumuliform lumpiness.\nThey also may line up in \u201cstreets\u201d or rows of clouds across the sky denoting localized areas of\nascent (cloud axes) and descent (cloud-free channels).\n\u0298 Which of the following conditions are necessary for the formation of a tropical cyclone?\n1. Sea surface temperature above 26.5\u00b0C\n2. Presence of Coriolis force\n3. A high-pressure system at the surface\n4. A small vertical wind shear\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below:\na) 1, 2, and 4 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1, 3, and 4 only\nd) 1 and 4 only\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Tropical cyclones are intense storms that form over tropical ocean waters and move toward\ncoastal regions, causing widespread devastation due to powerful winds (squalls), heavy rainfall\n(torrential rains), and storm surges.\n\uf0b7 These storms involve irregular wind patterns with air circulating around a low-pressure center in\na closed system. This whirling motion is driven by the rapid upward movement of warm air\ninfluenced by the Coriolis effect, which contributes to the high wind speeds at the center.ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 Cyclonic wind patterns rotate counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the\nsouthern hemisphere, due to the Coriolis force.\n\uf0b7 Cyclones are often accompanied by an anticyclone located between two cyclonic systems.\nConditions Favourable for Tropical Cyclone Formation:\n\uf0b7 Large sea surface with temperature higher than 27\u00b0 C.Hence condition 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Presence of the Coriolis force is enough to create a cyclonic vortex.Hence condition 2 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Small variations in the vertical wind speed,\n\uf0b7 A pre-existing weak low-pressure area or low-level-cyclonic circulation,Hence condition 3 is not\ncorrect.\n\uf0b7 Upper divergence above the sea level system\n\uf0b7 Wind shear ie., difference in wind speed or direction with height can disrupt the organized\nstructure of a developing cyclone by tilting or weakening it. For a tropical cyclone to form and\nintensify, minimal wind shear is required. Hence, condition4 is correct.

Germany\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statement\nStatement I:\nPreamble in itself is not justiciable\nStatement II:\nPreamble cannot be utilized by the judiciary to check the constitutionality of an Amendment or law.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\na) Both Statement I and Statement II are correct and Statement II is the correct explanation for\nStatement II\nb) Both Statement I and Statement II are correct and Statement II is not the correct explanation for\nStatement I\nc) Statement I is incorrect but Statement II is the correct.\nd) Statement I is correct and statement II is incorrect.\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Statement 1: Preamble in itself is not justiciable.\nThis statement is correct. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution serves as an introduction that\noutlines the fundamental values and principles upon which the Constitution is based. While it\nprovides context and guidance for interpreting the Constitution, it does not confer any rights or\nimpose any obligations that can be enforced by the judiciary. As such, the Preamble is considered\nnon-justiciable, meaning it cannot be the basis for a legal claim in court.\n\uf0b7 Statement 2: Preamble cannot be utilized by the judiciary to check the constitutionality of\nan Amendment or law.\nThis statement is incorrect. While the Preamble itself may not be justiciable, it can still be used\nby the judiciary as a guiding principle when interpreting the Constitution and assessing the\nconstitutionality of amendments or laws. The Supreme Court of India has acknowledged the\nPreamble's significance in several landmark judgments. For instance:\n\uf0b7 Kesavananda Bharati Case (1973): The Supreme Court held that the Preamble reflects the basic\nstructure of the Constitution. The principles enshrined in the Preamble, such as justice, liberty,\nequality, and fraternity, serve as essential guidelines for constitutional interpretation and the\nassessment of legislative and executive actions.\n\uf0b7 Minerva Mills Case (1980): The Supreme Court reiterated that the Preamble is important in\ndetermining the scope and interpretation of the Constitution and can be referred to while\nexamining the constitutionality of laws.\n\uf0b7 Thus, while the Preamble itself is not justiciable, it plays a crucial role in the judicial\ninterpretation of the Constitution and can influence the evaluation of the constitutionality of laws\nand amendments.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option D is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding \u201cRepresentational Legitimacy\u201d:\n1. The multiplicity of Political parties combined with the first past the post system results in a vast\nMajority of Parliamentarians and legislators getting elected in a minority vote.\n2. It is a said that the system of First Past of Post has the merit of preponderance of \u2018decisiveness\u2019\nover \u2018representativeness\u2019.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 only\nb) 2 only\nc) Both 1 and 2\nd) Neither 1 nor 2\nAns: CARAM IAS ACADEMY\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The multiplicity of political parties combined with the first past the post system results in a vast\nmajority of parliamentarians and legislators getting elected on a minority vote. The percentage\nof polling is itself quite low and those who win usually obtain less than 50 percent of votes cast,\ni.e. more votes cast against them than in their favour and the votes secured by them being a\nfraction of the electorate. A candidate is returned even if he gets less than one-third of the votes\npolled. There are extreme cases of some candidates who won on the basis of 18 percent of the\nvotes polled. On an average over 60 percent of the parliamentarians have won on a minority\nvote. It is said that the present Lok Sabha has 68 percent of its members elected on a minority\nvote. The votes secured by a successful candidate in the Assembly sectors on an average is 25\npercent of the votes polled. On an average only 50 per cent to 55 per cent of the voters turn up\nfor voting. This means in effect a winning candidate gets about 6 per cent of the votes of the\nelectorate in the constituency.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding the federal structure of the Indian Constitution:\n1. The Indian Constitution established a dual polity with distinct powers for the Union and the\nStates.\n2. According to the Indian Constitution, Union laws take precedence over state laws in conflicts\narising from the Concurrent List.\n3. The Union Parliament has the right to change the boundaries of any state without the permission\nof the legislature of the state.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 1 and 3 only\nc) 2 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 All three statements are correct. The Constitution of India is federal, with Article 246 dividing\npowers between the Union and the States. In the Concurrent List, the law of the union takes\nprecedence over state law in case of conflict. (Article 254). The Parliament has the authority to\nchange state boundaries (Article 3) without the consent of the State Legislature, but it must seek\nits advice.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option D is correct.\n\u0298 The Concept of Social Justice has been enshrined in the Preamble. This enables the court to\nuphold which of the following kind of legislation?\n1. Legislation enacted to remove economic inequalities.\n2. Legislation enacted to provide a descent standard of living to the working people.\n3. Legislation enacted to protect the interest of the weaker section of the society.\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below:\na) 3 only\nb) 1 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 2 only\nd) 1, 2 and 3\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and\nopportunities. It is enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution. Social Justice in Preamble\nenables the courts to uphold legislation:\na. to remove economic inequalities.\nb. to prove a decent standard of living to the working peopleARAM IAS ACADEMY\nc. to protect the interests of the weaker section of the society.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option D is correct.\n\u0298 Consider a person involved in agriculture and applied for PM-KISAN Scheme. But later the\napplication was rejected. In this context, which of the following is not the likely reason for the\napplication being rejected?\na) The applicant\u2019s family had land holding size of more than 2 hectares.\nb) Farmer who applied was an institutional land holder.\nc) The applicant paid lncome Tax in last assessment year.\nd) Both (a) and (b)\nAns: A\nWhy in news: Every fourth beneficiary added under PM-Kisan over past 2 months is a woman\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Every fourth beneficiary added under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan)\nscheme over the past two months is a woman, according to the data available with the Ministry of\nAgriculture and Farmers\u2019 Welfare.\n\uf0b7 The new beneficiaries were added to the scheme under the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra (VBSY),\nthe Centre\u2019s flagship initiative to raise awareness on its schemes.\n\uf0b7 Launched on November 15, 2023, around six months before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, VBSY\naims to achieve beneficiary saturation under government schemes.\n\uf0b7 ln the beginning when the PM-Kisan Scheme was launched on 24 February, 2019, its benefits were\nadmissible only to Small & Marginal Farmers' (SMF) families, with combined landholding up to 2\nhectare. The Scheme was later on revised w.e.f. 1 .6.2019 and extended to all farmer families\nirrespective of the size of their landholdings.

Mr. H. F. Blanford was\nappointed Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India. INC was formed in 1885.\n\uf0b7 The first Director General of Observatories was Sir John Eliot who was appointed in May 1889 at\nCalcutta headquarters. The headquarters of IMD were later shifted to Shimla, then to Poona (now\nPune) and finally to New Delhi.\n\uf0b7 IMD has always used contemporary technology. In the telegraph age, it made extensive use of\nweather telegrams for collecting observational data and sending warnings.\n\uf0b7 Later IMD became the first organisation in India to have a message switching computer for\nsupporting its global data exchange. One of the first few electronic computers introduced in the\ncountry was provided to IMD for scientific applications in meteorology.\n\uf0b7 India was the first developing country in the world to have its own geostationary satellite, INSAT,\nfor continuous weather monitoring of this part of the globe and particularly for cyclone warning.\n\uf0b7 IMD has partnered to contribute to the United Nations\u2019 \u2018Early Warning for All\u2019 programme, for\nwhich 30 countries have been identified.\n\uf0b7 IMD\u2019s cyclone forecasts now serve not just India but the entire neighbourhood, with as many as 13\ncountries in the region operating their cyclone management systems using these forecasts.\n\uf0b7 Hence all statements are correct.\n\uf0b7 Source:https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1996364\n\u0298 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shifts seasonally due to:\n1. The Earth's axial tilt.\n2. Variation in solar radiation received at different latitudes.\n3. Seasonal shifts in the sub-polar jet stream.\nSelect the correct answer using the code(s) given below:\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1, 2, and 3\nd) 1 only\nAns:A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a low-pressure area where the northeast and\nsoutheast trade winds meet. Typically situated near the equator and running almost parallel to it,\nthe ITCZ shifts north or south depending on the apparent movement of the sun.\n\uf0b7 The axial tilt of the Earth is the primary reason for the changing seasons. As the Earth orbits the\nSun, different latitudes receive varying amounts of solar energy, causing the ITCZ to shift northARAM IAS ACADEMY\nand south with the seasons. This tilt causes the position of the Sun to move between the Tropic of\nCancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, influencing the location of the ITCZ. Hence, Statement 1 is\ncorrect.\n\uf0b7 The ITCZ follows the region of maximum solar heating, which changes with the seasons. During\nsummer in either hemisphere, solar radiation is more intense, causing the ITCZ to shift towards\nthat hemisphere. Hence, Statement 2 is correct.\n\uf0b7 The sub-polar jet stream primarily affects weather patterns in higher latitudes and does not\ndirectly control the movement of the ITCZ, which is driven more by tropical solar heating and\ntrade winds. Hence, Statement 3 is not correct. So, option A is the answer.\n\u0298 In the context of the Hadley cell circulation, which of the following statements is correct?\na) It leads to heavy rainfall in the subtropical high-pressure zones.\nb) It explains the trade winds flowing from the equator towards the poles.\nc) It creates dry, desert-like conditions around 30\u00b0 latitude due to descending air.\nd) It is responsible for temperate cyclone formation at higher latitudes.\nAns:C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Hadley cell is a large-scale atmospheric circulation in which air rises near the equator, flows\npoleward at a high altitude, descends in the subtropics, and then flows equatorward near the\nsurface\n\uf0b7 Subtropical high-pressure zones are characterized by descending air, which is dry. This does not\nfavor heavy rainfall but instead leads to arid conditions. Hence, Statement A is incorrect.\n\uf0b7 Trade winds actually flow from the subtropical high-pressure zones towards the equator, not\ntowards the poles. Hence, Statement B is incorrect.\n\uf0b7 Temperate cyclones are primarily associated with the Ferrel cell, not the Hadley cell. They occur\nin the mid-latitudes where cold polar air meets warmer tropical air. Hence, Statement D is\nincorrectARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 As part of the Hadley cell circulation, air descends around 30\u00b0 latitude, creating high-pressure\nzones and arid conditions. This is why many of the world\u2019s deserts are found at these latitudes.\nHence, Statement C is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding the Greenhouse Effect:\n1. Water vapor is a more significant greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.\n2. Greenhouse gases trap the Earth's long-wave radiation, leading to warming.\n3. Without the greenhouse effect, Earth's surface temperature would be around -18\u00b0C.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The greenhouse effect is the natural warming of the earth that results when gases in the\natmosphere trap heat from the sun that would otherwise escape into space\n\uf0b7 While carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) is a critical greenhouse gas, water vapor is actually the most abundant\nand significant one in terms of its contribution to the natural greenhouse effect. It amplifies\nwarming because warmer air holds more moisture, which in turn traps more heat. Hence,\nStatement 1 is correct.\n\uf0b7 Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor trap infrared radiation (long-\nwave radiation) emitted by the Earth's surface. This trapped heat leads to warming of the\natmosphere, a fundamental mechanism behind the greenhouse effect. Hence, Statement 2 is\ncorrect.\n\uf0b7 The greenhouse effect is crucial for maintaining Earth's temperature. Without it, the planet\u2019s\naverage surface temperature would drop to around -18\u00b0C, making it uninhabitable for most life\nforms. Hence, Statement 3 is correct.So, option D is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Anticyclones:\n1. Winds move clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere.\n2. They are associated with stormy weather and precipitation.\n3. Air descends in an anticyclone, leading to clear skies.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns: C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 An anticyclone is a weather phenomenon defined as a large-scale circulation of winds around a\ncentral region of high atmospheric pressure.\n\uf0b7 It rotates clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter clockwise in the Southern\nHemisphere Hence statement 1 is correct\n\uf0b7 Effects of surface-based anticyclones include clearing skies as well as cooler, drier air. Fog can\nalso form overnight within a region of higher pressure. Hence statement 2 is not correct\n\uf0b7 In an anticyclone, the air descends, which compresses and warms, leading to clear skies and\nstable weather conditions. Hence statement 3 is correct.So, option C is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 Which of the following regions experiences a Mediterranean climate?\n1. Southern California\n2. South Western Australia\n3. Chilean coast\nSelect the correct answer using the codes given below:\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns: D\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Mediterranean climate is predominantly found in the western regions of continental landmasses,\nsituated between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 north and south of the equator. The primary cause of this climate is\nthe shifting of wind belts. The area surrounding the Mediterranean Sea has the largest expanse of\nthis climate, while its most developed form occurs in central Chile. So, option D is correct\n\uf0b7 Other regions with a Mediterranean climate include:\n\uf0fc Southern California (near San Francisco)\n\uf0fc The southwestern tip of Africa (around Cape Town)\n\uf0fc Southern and South Western Australia (in southern Victoria and around Adelaide, adjacent to\nSt. Vincent and Spencer Gulfs)\n\u0298 The Indian Constitution is often described as a \"living document.\" Which of the following\ncharacteristics best explains this feature?\n1. The Constitution provides for a flexible amendment procedure under Article 368.\n2. Judicial interpretation, through doctrines such as the Doctrine of Basic Structure, has ensured the\nadaptability of the Constitution.\n3. The Constitution allows for automatic updates based on social changes without formal\namendments.\nSelect the correct answer using the codes provided below:\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns: A\nExplanation:ARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\uf0b7 The Constitution is considered \"living\" due to its flexible amendment procedure (Article 368) and\nthe dynamic judicial interpretations. (like the Basic Structure Doctrine). However, there is no\nprovision for automatic updates without formal amendments, so Statement 3 is incorrect.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following statements regarding Parliamentary form of Government:\nStatement1:\nThe Indian Constitution establishes a parliamentary form of government in which the executive is\naccountable to the legislature.\nStatement 2:\nThe Prime Minister, as head of government, has enormous powers, although they are subject to the\nconfidence of the Lok Sabha.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\na) Both Statement I and Statement II are correct and Statement II is the correct explanation for\nStatement II\nb) Both Statement I and Statement II are correct and Statement II is not the correct explanation for\nStatement I\nc) Statement I is incorrect but Statement II is the correct.\nd) Statement I is correct and statement II is incorrect.\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 In India's parliamentary system, the administration is accountable to the legislature, and the\nPrime Minister relies on the confidence of the Lok Sabha. Both statements provide a\ncomprehensive view of the parliamentary system. But Statement II does not explain Statement I\nas both the statement is description of Parliamentary System of Government.\n\uf0b7 Collective responsibility and accountability to legislature is cardinal features of Parliamentary\nSystem of Government.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.\n\u0298 Which of the following fulfils the objective of Political Justice?\na) Independent Election Commission\nb) Universal Adult Suffrage\nc) Independent Judiciary\nd) Political Parties.\nAns: B\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Political Justice means the absence of any arbitrary distinction between man and man in the\npolitical sphere. In order to ensure the \u2018political\u2019 justice held out by the Preamble, it was essential\nthat every person in the territory of India, irrespective of his proprietary of educational\nqualifications, should be allowed to participate in the political system like any other person.\nUniversal adult suffrage was adopted with this object in view. This mean that every five years,\nthe member of the Legislatures of the Union and of each State Shall be elected by the vote of the\nentire adult population, according to the principle \u2013 \u2018one man, one vote\u2019.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option B is correct.\n\u0298 Consider the following pairs:\nType of Justice Constitutional Provision\n1. Social Justice Article 39(a)- Free legal aid to the poor\n2. Economic Justice Article 326 - Election\n3. Political Justice Article 16(4) - Reservation\nHow many of the above are correctly matched?\na) Only one\nb) Only twoARAM IAS ACADEMY\nc) Only three\nd) None\nAns:C\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 Social Justice (Article 16(4)): Ensures reservations in public employment for backward classes.\nAlthough it is a social justice it contains within it the fundamentals of political justice\n\uf0b7 Economic Justice (Article 39(a)): Promotes equal distribution of material resources. This\nincludes aspect of social justice.\n\uf0b7 Political Justice (Article 326): Relates to adult suffrage and electoral participation. Election does\nnot discriminate the rich and poor and thus also economic justice.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option C is correct.\n\u0298 The Indian Constitution has been characterised as a combination of rigidity and flexibility.\nWhich of the following amendment procedures exemplifies this characteristic?\n1. Certain constitutional provisions can be modified by a simple majority in Parliament.\n2. Certain clauses require a special majority in both chambers of Parliament and ratification by at\nleast half of the state legislatures.\n3. Constitutional amendments require a referendum.\nSelect the correct answer using the code provided below.\na) 1 and 2 only\nb) 2 and 3 only\nc) 1 and 3 only\nd) 1, 2, and 3\nAns: A\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The Indian Constitution allows for amendments by a simple majority (for example, changing the\nnames of states), while more significant clauses require a special majority and the ratification of\nthe states. There is no provision for a referendum on constitutional amendments.\n\uf0b7 Thus, option A is correct.\n\u0298 The SEAMA Eco-region often seen in news is located in?\na) Europe\nb) Africa\nc) Asia\nd) Latin America\nAns:B\nWhy in news?\nExplanation:\n\uf0b7 The SEAMA is a newly recognized ecoregion in Southern Africa, extending across northern\nMozambique and including Mount Mulanje in Malawi. Known for its mountainous landscape,\nSEAMA features a variety of habitats, including montane forests, grasslands, and rocky cliffs.\nAlthough it was identified only recently, SEAMA is recognized as a biodiversity hotspot, home to a\nwide range of plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate species.\nSo, option B is correctARAM IAS ACADEMY\n\u0298 How many of the following countries are without a coastline?\n1.
